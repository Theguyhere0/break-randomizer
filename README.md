# break-randomizer
A little JS and React app for randomizing break activities (mostly to practice my coding skills).
I used Semantic UI React because I was not about to do my own CSS.

The layout should be pretty intuitive, so run the app and you'll know how it works. Data are stored in local storage. The web app runs on a simple local server, so to run the app run the command "npm run start." Then go to localhost: 3000 in your web browser and you'll find the site running. It's beyond my scope atm to do anything more than that.

To make this process a little simpler, create a shortcut with this target:
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k cd \ & cd [location of app folder] & npm run start

You'll need to supply the location of where you stored your own app folder. I used Windows 10 during this process, so those with a different OS will need to adjust commands accordingly.

Oh yeah, there are known bugs if you purposely try to mess around too much. If there's a glaring bug, though, please let me know.
